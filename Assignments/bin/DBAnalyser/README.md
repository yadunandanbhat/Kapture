## Getting Started

I've written this program assuming some things.
First is that the database you're using is MySQL.
Second is that the DATETIME format in your database follows the MySQL's DATETIME format.
You need to enter the URL, username, password in 'src/sqlConnector.java' file and the table name in the 'src/Analyser.java' file.

If the output doesn't print, use OneCompiler to just the SQL file and see the output there.
I don't know Spring Boot, so I didn't use that.

You might encounter some errors, but please deal with it patiently as I'm still a fresher and I don't have experience writing production level code.
