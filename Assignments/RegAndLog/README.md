## Getting Started

Write a dynamic web site which connects to a local database and can register/login a user, display their profile and log them out. It should be noted that this web site should have session management. It should not be possible to access the profile page without logging in. Also cover the edge cases while registering and logging in.

## Outline

- Connect to a database
- Register a new user
- Login as a user
- Display prompts after every action
- Access profile page after logging in
- Log out
